# Project-1-Movie-Trailer-Website 
by Heber Gonzalez

Project for the Udacity Full Stack Web Developer Nanodegree Program 

## Description and Function

This python program displays a list of some of my favorite movies in a website. It also allows you to click 
on the movie posters and view trailers for said movies.

## Required Libraries and Dependencies

This program requires python 2.7x to be installed. All libraries are included in the zip file.

## Zip File Contents

The zip file "movies.rar" consists of the following file:

1. entertainment_center.py
2. media.py
3. fresh_tomatoes.py
4. info.py
5. README.md

## How to Run

1. Download zip file movies.rar
2. Unzip movies.rar
3. Open "movies" folder
4. Double click on or run "entertainment_center.py"

After step 4, your browser should launch the movie trailer website.

## Miscellaneous

Some visual aspects of the website have been modified. These are the following changes:

- Movie poster roll-over box color
- Movie title font color
- Navbar text and color
- Trailer window size

The code for fresh_tomatoes.py was provided by Udacity.
